                        <p>Let's face it: you're being scammed. Scams abound. They are all around us, and they're constantly trying to pry our hard earned money away from us. They are proliferating online, on social media, in politics, in movies and television, over the phone, through text messages, over email, and through every other sort of medium you can think of.</p>
                        <p>It's not embarrassing. We've all been a victim in one way or another: whether it's giving some African prince all of our savings, investing in multilevel marketing, clicking a questionable link in an email, or even something more innocuous, like picking up a multivitamin at the store, buying supplements and protein powders from a radio host, taking part in some fad diet, buying the latest trending thing from your favorite influencer, or shelling out over $150,000 to drive around a sheet of stainless steel, we've all been there and we've all been scammed.</p>
                        <p>We're here to be your guide through this tangled web of a world and help you spot and understand the scams that are lurking all around us. We write on different types of scams, known scams, and how you can protect yourself from being a victim yourself. We personally know people (friends and family) who have been victims of life-altering scams, scam artists, and con men, and we bet you do too. That's why we're diving head first into this world to offer up insights and heads-up information about the current threat landscape and what you, your family, and your friends can do to avoid becoming that next victim.</p>
